# Screenshot Instructions

To add a screenshot to the README:

1. Run the CCUsageMac application
2. Click on the menu bar icon to show the popover
3. Take a screenshot of the popover showing:
   - Total cost
   - Token breakdown
   - Models used
   - Last updated time

4. Save the screenshot as `docs/screenshot.png`

The screenshot should ideally show:
- A meaningful cost amount (not $0.00)
- Multiple models if possible (e.g., "opus-4, sonnet-4")
- Clear token usage breakdown

You can use macOS's built-in screenshot tool:
- Press Cmd+Shift+4
- Press Space to capture a window
- Click on the popover window

Make sure the screenshot is:
- Clear and readable
- Shows the full popover
- Has a clean background
- Is saved as PNG format
