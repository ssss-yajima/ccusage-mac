## Overview

ccusage-mac is a macOS menu bar application inspired by [ccusage](https://github.com/ryoppippi/ccusage). It reads Claude Code's locally stored usage data and displays your costs in the menu bar, updating automatically every 5 minutes.

## Features

- ðŸ“Š **Real-time Cost Display**: Shows today's usage cost in the menu bar
- ðŸ“… **Weekly View**: See the last 7 days of usage in a table format
- ðŸ”„ **Auto-refresh**: Updates every 5 minutes automatically
- ðŸ“ˆ **Detailed Breakdown**: View token usage details
- ðŸ§  **Model Tracking**: See which Claude models you've used (Opus, Sonnet, etc.)
- ðŸ”’ **Privacy First**: No network access, no external servers

## Privacy & Security

**This app works completely offline:**
- No network requests are made
- No API keys required
- Simply reads JSONL files from `~/.claude/projects/`
- Your usage data never leaves your computer

## How It Works

The app calculates costs by:

1. **Reading local data**: Scans `~/.claude/projects/*/api_conversations/*.jsonl` files that Claude Code automatically generates
2. **Calculating costs**: Uses Anthropic's official pricing:
   - **Opus 4**: $15/MTok input, $75/MTok output
   - **Sonnet 4**: $3/MTok input, $15/MTok output
   - **Haiku 3.5**: $0.80/MTok input, $4/MTok output
3. **Deduplication**: Uses messageId:requestId hash to avoid counting duplicates
4. **Date filtering**: Matches dates using local timezone

## Installation

### Requirements

- macOS 13.0 (Ventura) or later
- Claude Code must be installed and have usage data

### Download from GitHub Releases (Recommended)

1. Go to [Releases](https://github.com/ssss-yajima/ccusage-mac/releases)
2. Download the latest `.dmg` file
3. Double-click the DMG and drag CCUsageMac to Applications
4. Launch CCUsageMac from Applications folder

**Important Security Note**: 
- On first launch, macOS may show a security warning since the app is not notarized
- Right-click (or Control-click) on the app and select "Open" from the context menu
- Click "Open" in the dialog that appears
